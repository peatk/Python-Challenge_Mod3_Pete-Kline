<h3>UC Berkeley: Data Analytics

<h4>PyBank Instructions

<h6>
In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

#1 The total number of months included in the dataset

#2 The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#3 The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

#4 The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#5 The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#6 Print final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

#1 The total number of votes cast

#2 A complete list of candidates who received votes

#3 The percentage of votes each candidate won

#4 The total number of votes each candidate won

#5 The winner of the election based on popular vote
